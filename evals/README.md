To get started, set your OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable, or other required keys for the providers you selected.

For convenience, the `OPENAI_API_KEY` will be copied from `.dev.vars` when running `npm run evals` from the root of the project. Otherwise, it needs to be set manually.

Next, edit promptfooconfig.yaml.

Then run:
```
promptfoo eval
```

Afterwards, you can view the results by running `promptfoo view`
